            We have a dedicated outlook towards the improvement of our services, to our clients. As part of this promise, we have added to our infrastructure, both tangibly and intangibly.
            For easing out of reach to our customers, we have added this new portal to our business venture.

            Sound and Stage Entertainment has been set up, as an automated system to facilitate across the counter and online booking. The online option will enable users the following options:
            <ul>
            <li>Advance Ticket Booking</li>
            <li>Preferred Seat Selection</li>
            <li>Order Snacks</li>
            </ul>
            
            
            A real-time Web-based interface that can be used for making bookings at the ticket counters. This Web interface will connect you with us in a very new way. This ticketing system will generate tickets at a considerable rate to cope up with the heavy footfall at the theaters.
